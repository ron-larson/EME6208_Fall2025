			<p>For this project, I created a 14-second animation titled "<strong>What is Debugging?</strong>" to visually explain a core concept from my 7th-grade computer science unit, <strong>"Block Busters: Building and Fixing Our First App."</strong> The animation's educational value is in how it demystifies debugging for students. It visually portrays a common bug&mdash;a sprite moving through a wall&mdash;and contrasts a vague instruction ("MOVE 100 STEPS") with a precise, logical fix ("IF NOT touching_wall THEN MOVE"). This reinforces the idea from our unit's "Debugging Log" that fixing errors is not a random guess, but a systematic process of testing, identifying a logical flaw, and implementing a specific solution.</p>
			<p>My creation process began with storyboarding the animation in Adobe Animate. I imported a Cat vector sprite image from the Scratch coding environment (because it is used in a lot of beginning K-12 computer coding classes) and drew the simple wall rectangle directly on the stage. The primary animation was achieved using a <strong>motion tween</strong> to slide the cat. I also used <strong>motion tweens</strong> for all transition effects, applying them to the <strong>Alpha property</strong> of the title text, the pseudocode, the red "X" for the error, and the green "✓" for the solution. After exporting this visual-only .mp4 file, I imported it into <strong>Canva</strong> to sync it with my audio voice-over that I recorded using <strong>Audacity</strong>, creating the final video.</p>
			<p>The main challenge I faced was the complexity of Adobe Animate. As a professional-grade tool, its learning curve is steep for a short project. For instance, creating the fade effects required first <strong>converting each text block and shape into a 'symbol'</strong> before a motion tween could even be applied. It then took time to locate the <strong>Alpha property slider</strong> within the object's properties to control the transparency. The most significant challenge, however, was mastering the timeline to precisely synchronize all these layered tweens. Getting the cat's movement, the text, and the "X" and "✓" symbols to appear and disappear at the exact moments to match the 14-second voice-over required several attempts and fine-tuning.</p>
