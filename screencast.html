		<h1>Screencasting</h1>
		<p>This project required presenting a software demonstration topic lasting approximately 2 – 4 minutes by using either a trial version of Camtasia, or CamStudio, or some other equivalent tool to record a narrated screencast. A follow-on project had similar requirements, but instead focused on reviewing and evaluating an AI video production tool of my choice. </p>

			<h3>Project Reflection</h3>
			<p>For the <strong>software demonstration screencast</strong>, I once again selected a specific, focused skill from a 7th-grade Computer Science Unit Plan that I developed over the Summer 2025 term ("Block Busters: Building and Fixing Our First App"): debugging a common sprite movement error in Scratch.</p>
			<p>A two-column script was drafted before recording, mapping the narration directly to the on-screen actions and planning cues for post-production effects, to help ensure instructional clarity. <strong>Tool selection was critical.</strong> After evaluating options, I chose the desktop version of <strong>Camtasia</strong> (trial) as it was the only tool that provided the necessary post-production zoom, pan, and cursor animation features required by the rubric.</p>
			<p>The production process involved recording, followed by a detailed editing phase. In editing, I added the planned <strong>zoom and pan animations</strong>, applied <strong>cursor highlighting</strong>, and polished the video with a <strong>solid background</strong> and added <strong>title/end frames</strong> that used <strong>fade transitions</strong>. The final video (2:32) was then exported as an .mp4 and uploaded to YouTube.</p>
			<p>For the <strong>AI-generated video demonstration screencast</strong>, I evaluated <strong>Visla</strong>, an AI-powered video creation platform designed to lower the technical barrier for educators and students. Its primary educational utility is efficiency; it allows users to transform text-based lesson plans or essays into video content without needing complex editing software.</p>
			<p>To test this utility, I conducted a direct comparison by feeding Visla a reflection I had previously written about a <i>manually created</i>manually created Adobe Animate project. This allowed me to contrast "AI ease" against "manual precision."</p>
			<p>The results revealed a significant trade-off. While Visla is marketed as a time-saver, the "efficiency" was debatable for specific technical content. In my test, it took Visla <strong>2 minutes and 4 seconds</strong> to generate a video that was only <strong>12 seconds long (including 4 seconds of ending credits)</strong>. Furthermore, the AI’s visual selection was generic; where my original Animate project logically depicted a specific cat "sprite" hitting a wall to explain debugging, Visla substituted this with animated footage of a cat jumping up on and playing with what looked like a “box” (instead of a “wall”). I did find it interesting that the cat was “speaking” the voiceover towards the end of the generated video.</p>
			<p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> Visla is a powerful tool for rapid, generalized content creation, such as converting a history  essay or brief blog posts into a mood-based presentation. However, for Computer Science education where specific visual logic is required, the AI’s lack of granular control is a hindrance. The tool is best used for broad overviews, while manual tools like Adobe Animate remain superior for illustrating and explaining complex technical concepts.</p>
