		<h1>Video Production</h1>
<p>This project required the creation of an artistic digital production using Microsoft MovieMaker or iMovie (or in my case, Canva). Instead of live video footage, still image production embracing a theme ("What Is an Algorithm?") were modified using techniques such as zooms, and pans that dissolve, fade, and wipe into one another.</p>

			<h3>Project Reflection</h3>

			<p>This project, an educational video titled <strong>"What Is an Algorithm?"</strong>, is a key component of my semester-long curriculum development work. It was designed as a digital instructional asset for my 7th-grade Computer Science unit plan, <strong>"Block Busters: Building and Fixing Our First App."</strong> The video's core concept is based on a classic "unplugged" classroom activity: the "Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich" analogy. This pedagogical approach was intentionally chosen to demystify the abstract concept of an algorithm, making it concrete and accessible by showing 7th-grade students how a computer requires precise, logical, step-by-step instructions for even the simplest tasks.</p>

			<p>The production process involved a multi-tool workflow. I began by recording the voice-over narration in <strong>Audacity</strong>, exporting it as a high-quality .WAV file to serve as the project's audio foundation. The video was then assembled in Canva's Standard Editor, where I synchronized 17 still images, one live-action clip, and the narration. A primary technical requirement was to ensure the audio was mixed professionally. I placed the music and narration on separate tracks, significantly lowering the background music volume to ensure the instructional voice-over was always clear and complemented by the audio.</p>

			<p>To create a polished and engaging final product, I integrated numerous on-screen captions for reinforcement, applied panning and zooming (Ken Burns) effects to give motion to still images, and used a variety of transitions (like Dissolve and Match &amp; Move) and video effects (such as overlays, blurs, and opacity changes). The final 2:26 video demonstrates my ability to translate a hands-on lesson into a durable, digital format while adhering to professional standards for media production and attribution.</p>
