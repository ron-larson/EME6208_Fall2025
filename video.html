		<h1>Video Production</h1>
<p>This project required the creation of an artistic digital production using Microsoft MovieMaker or iMovie (or in my case, Canva). Instead of live video footage, still image production embracing a theme ("What Is an Algorithm?") were modified using techniques such as zooms, and pans that dissolve, fade, and wipe into one another.</p>

			<p>My video is an informational piece titled <strong>"What Is an Algorithm?"</strong> which is directly based on an "unplugged" activity from my 7th-grade Computer Science unit plan, <strong>"Block Busters: Building and Fixing Our First App."</strong>. The video uses the "peanut butter and jelly sandwich" analogy to explain why computers require precise, step-by-step instructions.</p>
			<p>Here is a summary of the media and manipulations I performed to create this video:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Software Used:</strong> I used <strong>Canva's</strong> video editor (in Standard Mode) to assemble and edit the project.</li>
    <li><strong>Audio Production:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Narration:</strong> I recorded my own voice-over narration using <strong>Audacity</strong> and exported it as a high-quality .WAV file.</li>
        <li><strong>Background Music:</strong> I used the royalty-free track <strong>"Equatorial Complex" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</strong>, as required by the license.</li>
        <li><strong>Audio Mixing:</strong> In Canva, I placed the narration and music on separate tracks and significantly <strong>lowered the volume of the music track</strong> to ensure the narration was clear and complemented by the music, rather than being overpowered by it.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Visual Media:</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Images:</strong> I used 17 high-resolution still images sourced from Pexels and iStockPhoto.</li>
        <li><strong>Video:</strong> I also integrated one short, live-action video clip (the father and son) to enhance the PB&amp;J analogy.</li>
    </ul>
    <li><strong>Editing Manipulations &amp; Effects (per the rubric):</strong></li>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Formal Title &amp; Credits:</strong> The video begins with a formal title screen and ends with a "Thank You" and credits screen that provides full attribution for both the music and image sources.</li>
        <li><strong>Screen Captions:</strong> I used numerous on-screen text captions to reinforce the narration and highlight key concepts (e.g., "You want a 'sandwich'?", "What Do I Do? Hmm...", "An Algorithm!!!").</li>
        <li><strong>Panning &amp; Zooming:</strong> I applied the Ken Burns effect (using Canva's "Animate" feature) to several images. Two clear examples are the slow zoom-in on the "spreading peanut butter" image and the pan/zoom effect on the "student on the stairs" image.</li>
        <li><strong>Transitions:</strong> I used multiple Dissolve, Fade, and Match &amp; Move transitions to move smoothly between different visual clips throughout the video.</li>
        <li><strong>Other Video Effects:</strong> I applied several other effects, including:</li>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Overlays/Opacity:</strong> Using blended/faded overlays, such as the sandwich appearing over the math background.</li>
            <li><strong>Ghosting/Echo:</strong> Applying an echo effect to the "student on the stairs" image to create a sense of motion.</li>
            <li><strong>Blur/Flash:</strong> Using blur and flash effects on the Scratch code images [0:35] for visual emphasis.</li>
        </ol>
    </ul>
</ul>
			<p>The final video was rendered as an .mp4 file with a total runtime of 2:26.</p>
