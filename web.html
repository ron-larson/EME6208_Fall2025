			    <h3>Project Reflection</h3>
			    <p>For my web design work, I focused on exploring different methods for creating interactive assessments. I adapted two separate projects to build learning tools for a 7th-grade computer science unit that I previously developed, <strong>"Block Busters: Building and Fixing Our First App"</strong>, with each project presenting a unique set of technical challenges and learning opportunities.</p>
			    
			    <p>The first project, the <strong>"Code Breakers" Quiz</strong>, was an exercise in <strong>JavaScript</strong> logic. I modified a foundational script from <a href="http://javascriptkit.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">JavaScript Kit</a> to expand the question bank from five to ten, creating new, age-appropriate content on the topic of algorithms. The primary challenge was a data-parsing bug; I discovered that double quotes (<code>"</code>) within the question text caused a JavaScript error that prevented questions from rendering. I debugged this by systematically re-adding each question, isolating the error, and implementing the correct escape sequence (<code>\"</code>).</p>
			    
			    <p>The second project, the <strong>"Code Concepts" Drag-and-Drop Assessment</strong>, was a deeper dive into <strong>layout, CSS, and JavaScript-driven DOM manipulation</strong>. I significantly re-engineered the structure from three to four content categories (Algorithm, Variable, Loop, and Conditional) and replaced all content items. To enhance its instructional use, I added a "Quiz Mode" checkbox that dynamically instructs the JavaScript to lock answers upon being dropped. The main challenge was a series of CSS and layout conflicts. I had to widen the main containers to prevent the fourth box from wrapping, and then debug a script that was overriding my styles. I solved this by commenting out a problematic JavaScript height-fix and using CSS (<code>min-height: 150px;</code> and <code>overflow: auto</code>) to manage the layout, fix a collapsing container, and ensure drop-zones were visible.</p>
			    
			    <p>Finally, these projects highlighted the importance of <strong>User Interface (UI) usability</strong>. In the drag-and-drop activity, I realized that simply having the code "work" was not enough; the user needed visual feedback. I added a cursor change (<code>cursor: move</code>) in the CSS so students would intuitively know which elements were interactable. This small detail significantly improved the user experience, reinforcing the lesson that good web design is as much about how a tool <em>feels</em> as how it functions. This work tracked my own tool progression as well; I edited the first project in Notepad, but as the complexity grew, I moved to <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Visual Studio Code</a>, which proved invaluable for managing the interconnected HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files.</p>
