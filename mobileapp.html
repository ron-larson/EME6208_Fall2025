		<h1>Mobile App Development</h1>
		<p>This project required developing a mobile app using AppInventor. It also required outlining the development process used in the creation of this app, evaluating the usability of the AppInventor software, and outlining one's next steps to advance one's knowledge of mobile app development.</p>

					<h3>About the App</h3>
					<p>The <strong>"Block Busters" Unit Quiz App</strong> is a multiple-choice assessment tool designed for a 7th-grade Computer Science unit plan entitled "Block Busters: Building and Fixing Our First App". It cycles through 18 questions covering core unit concepts like Algorithms, Debugging, and Collaboration.</p>

		    <h3>Project Reflection: Engineering the "Block Busters" Unit Quiz</h3>
		    
		    <p>For Project 9, I customized the <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/quizme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"QuizMe" tutorial</a> to engineer the <strong>"Block Busters" Unit Quiz</strong>, a mobile application designed as a summative review tool for my previously developed 7th-grade Computer Science unit plan. The app utilizes parallel lists to manage 20 targeted questions, specifically tailored to reference class artifacts like the "Marshmallow Challenge" and the "PB&J Algorithm" video. This ensures the digital tool feels relevant to the physical classroom experience.</p>
		
		    <p><strong>Development & Enhancements:</strong><br />
		    My development process utilized a hybrid workflow, coding on a <strong>Windows 11 PC</strong> while live-testing on an <strong>Android phone</strong> via the AI Companion app. To exceed the basic requirements, I focused on User Experience (UX) and Visual Design. I integrated a custom app icon and used GIMP to process a background image at 38% opacity for optimal text readability. I also hardened the logic by scripting a custom ToggleButtons procedure to prevent a "spam-click" bug I discovered during testing, ensuring the scoring system remains robust. Specifically, I used a control variable to disable the answer buttons immediately after a user selection, preventing them from racking up points by repeatedly tapping the correct answer before the 'Next' button appeared. This small logic gate was essential for maintaining the integrity of the assessment data.</p>
		    
		    <p><strong>Evaluating App Inventor:</strong><br />
		    From an educator's perspective, App Inventor is an excellent parallel to the Scratch environment, perfectly bridging the gap between "drag-and-drop" logic and real-world deployment. However, coming from a background in <strong>C++ and Python</strong>, I found the "Blocks" editor occasionally restrictive. Logic structures I could type in seconds required dragging, dropping, and snapping multiple visual elements. While excellent for novices, it highlighted the efficiency trade-offs of visual programming.</p>
		    
		    <p><strong>Next Steps:</strong><br />
		    Currently, the quiz is sequential. My goal for "Version 2.0" is to implement question randomization, which requires a complex "list of lists" data structure to maintain data integrity—a significant logical challenge compared to standard text-based arrays. Beyond this tool, I plan to explore <strong><a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Android Studio</a> using <a href="https://developer.android.com/studio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kotlin</a></strong> to leverage my object-oriented programming background, mirroring the progression from "Blocks to Text" that I model for my students.</p>
