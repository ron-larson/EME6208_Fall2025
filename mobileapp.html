		<h1>Mobile App Development</h1>
		<p>This project required developing a mobile app using AppInventor. It also required outlining the development process used in the creation of this app, evaluating the usability of the AppInventor software, and outlining one's next steps to advance one's knowledge of mobile app development.</p>

					<h3>About the App</h3>
					<p>The <strong>"Block Busters" Unit Quiz App</strong> is a multiple-choice assessment tool designed for a 7th-grade Computer Science unit plan entitled "Block Busters: Building and Fixing Our First App". It cycles through 18 questions covering core unit concepts like Algorithms, Debugging, and Collaboration.</p>

			<h3>Project Reflection</h3>
			<p>For this project, I customized the <a href="https://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/quizme" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"QuizMe" tutorial</a> to create the <strong>"Block Busters" Unit Quiz</strong>. The application serves as a summative review tool, utilizing parallel lists (Questions vs. Answers) and an index variable to track user progress. I specifically tailored the content to reference our class activities, such as the "Marshmallow Challenge" and the "PB&J Algorithm" video, ensuring the digital tool felt relevant to the physical classroom experience. My development process utilized a hybrid workflow; I coded the logic on an iPad Pro while live-testing the functionality on an Android phone via the AI Companion.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Evaluating the Usability of App Inventor:</strong><br />
			From an educator's perspective, AppInventor's block-based system is an excellent parallel to the Scratch environment my students use. It bridges the gap perfectly between "drag-and-drop" logic and real-world app deployment. However, as a seasoned programmer accustomed to C++ and Python, the "Blocks" editor was occasionally restrictive. Simple logic structures that I could type in seconds required dragging, dropping, and snapping together multiple visual elements. The most critical part of my process was the "Testing" phase, where I had to ensure that my specific curriculum questions (like the "Lead Tester" role definition) correctly triggered the right feedback.</p>
			
			<p><strong>Next Steps in Mobile Development:</strong><br />
			Currently, the quiz presents questions in a fixed order. My goal for "Version 2.0" is to implement a randomization feature. This would require a more advanced data structure (like a list of lists) to ensure the questions and answers remain linked when shuffled—a significant logical challenge compared to the text-based arrays I am used to. Beyond this tool, I plan to explore <strong>Android Studio using Kotlin</strong> to leverage my object-oriented programming background while gaining granular control over mobile hardware, mirroring the progression I aim to model for my students as they advance from blocks to text.</p>
